    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Forage is an app which uses geo-location technology to make your visit to Wellington recreational parks better. This app allows you to easily access pre-planned circuits of parks such as Zealandia, Wellington Zoo and the Botanic Gardens. Not only this but as you walk Forage will record your location on the map so you can see exactly where you are and where you’d like to go. Forage is also incredibly interactive allowing you to pick a point on the map and find out some information surrounding it to see if it interests you and is worth visiting. As you pass significant points on the map you will receive push notifications asking you if you would like more information about this section of the park. It can also tell you if you should return later for more optimal viewing of something. This works through Geo-fencing which will accompany Geo-location in this app. Furthermore, as you walk along you can save spots for later by dragging the point into the side menu. This allows you to save spots that you want to go back to or visit another time. To help users realise that Forage is available as soon as they enter the park they will receive a notification asking them if they’d like to download it. </p>

    <h2>Syncing</h2>
    <p>Unlike other mapping technology, forage also allows you to connect live with other people. By placing your phone near your friends phones you can all match up on the map. This way you will be able to see your friend’s location even if you are separated or wish to visit different sections of the park. When you want to visit your friend’s location you can simply click visit and this will send them a notification to stay where they are and that you are on your way. This makes it unnecessary to keep having to exit forage in order to text or call your friends to find out where they have gone. You can add up to 6 people per map. Another feature of this is a meeting place, if you are lost and Forage for some reason is not displaying your friends you can travel back to the planned meeting place on your map and once you get there your friends will receive a notification of your arrival. This is particularly good for families who sometimes lose younger members. This way they will easily be able to find their way to the meeting point and also the parents will not have to worry so much. </p>

    <h2>Local Users</h2>
    <p>Forage can be used by all ages and is incredibly user friendly. As long as you have a smartphone you are able to connect to the Forage app. You will need Wi-Fi to download this app but there is always some part of these parks that will offer Wi-Fi, including Wellington CBD Wi-Fi. You can also download before you leave home or use your own personal data. Forage is particularly useful for kids aged 10-14 who may be travelling with their family and would normally not be allowed to venture away from their family. The group application allows parents to feel safer in letting their children roam the park without their supervision. As when sharing a map, you can see everyone’s position in the park that is in your group. Furthermore, sometimes texting and calling is made complicated in these places and people find it difficult to explain exactly where they are. Forage is also very useful for frequent visitors who can save their favourite spots and find the fastest way to get there. It also enables them to connect pre-created circuits which they may have never tried before.</p>

  <div class="column" style="justify-content:100%;">
    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>Forage will be especially good for tourists as the application can be translated into different languages. This will enable visitors to be able to access the information that they usually might not because they cannot read English. Furthermore, it is an easier version of mapping than the paper maps available at parks at the moment.  As similarly to google maps this application takes you to your destination rather than you having to figure it out all by yourself. The saved spots can also be kept to show family members at home what your favourite sections of a particular place were. Not to mention when you take a picture whilst Forage is operating (even in the background) you will immediately have a location-tag on this image. Forage will also be able to connect to transportation that tourists may be relying to get back to the cruise ship etc… Allowing them to choose which time they think they will be finished and then presenting them with transport options.</p>

    <h2>Further Development</h2>

   <p>Forage could be in future developed further to operate with AR technology. Allowing you to take pictures of things like, flora and fauna and then presenting the information. This would cancel out the geo-fencing push notifications which would allow a simpler use of this application. You would be able to simply take a photo of a bird and then the information would pop up rather than getting notifications on things you may not want to visit or are not interested in. Looking at the google translate AR technologies this development would not be too far off.</p>
